## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a Rust application to parse and merge bank statements from different CSV formats. This will streamline the analysis and reconciliation of financial data from various sources.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust CSV parser in Rust.
- Support multiple bank statement formats.
- Implement a merging logic to consolidate data.
- Provide a clean and flexible command-line interface.
- Ensure data integrity and accuracy in the merging process.

## Requirements
- Rust Programming Language
- CSV Parsing library (e.g., `csv`)
- Command-line interface (CLI) library (e.g., `clap`)
- Test framework (e.g., `cargo test`)
- Git for version control
- Documentation tools (e.g., Markdown)

## Milestones
1. [MVP Preparation] Set up project repository and dependencies.
2. [CSV Parsing] Implement the basic CSV parsing functionality.
3. [Format Support] Add support for multiple CSV formats.
4. [Merging Logic] Implement the logic to merge different formats.
5. [CLI Implementation] Develop and integrate a command-line interface.
6. [Testing & Validation] Rigorously test the application.
7. [Documentation] Provide comprehensive documentation and examples.

## Architecture
- **Parser Module**: Handles reading and parsing of CSV files.
- **Format Adapter Module**: Adjusts data from various CSV structures into a common format.
- **Merger Module**: Merges parsed data into a consolidated format.
- **CLI Module**: Provides user interface for executing the merger and accessing help/documentation.

## Tasks
- **Setup**
  - Initialize Git repository.
  - Configure Rust project with `cargo`.
  - Set up continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

- **CSV Parsing**
  - Choose a CSV library.
  - Implement basic parsing functionality.
  - Write unit tests for parsing functionality.

- **Format Support**
  - Identify common bank statement formats.
  - Implement adapter for each format.
  - Validate accuracy of adapter transformations.

- **Merging Logic**
  - Define common data model.
  - Implement merging algorithm.
  - Write tests to ensure correct merging.

- **CLI Implementation**
  - Design CLI commands and options.
  - Implement CLI with a library.
  - Test CLI for usability.

- **Testing & Validation**
  - Write integration tests.
  - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT).
  - Conduct data accuracy validation.

- **Documentation**
  - Write user guide and API documentation.
  - Provide examples and how-to guides.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Setup and CSV Parsing
- **Week 3-4**: Format Support
- **Week 5**: Merging Logic
- **Week 6**: CLI Implementation
- **Week 7**: Testing & Validation
- **Week 8**: Documentation and Final Review

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Complex Format Handling**: Research format specifications; engage with stakeholders.
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Implement comprehensive test coverage and validations.
- **User Interface Confusion**: Conduct user testing and gather feedback.
